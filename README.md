# Z3R

Z3R is a fork of the `zelda3` C reimplementation By SnesRev this project's widescreen,
HUD, settings, and early randomizer work. The source builds a native executable
and a generated runtime asset file named `zelda3_assets.dat`.

This repository does not replace owning the game. You need your own legally
dumped copy of `Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (USA)` to extract the
runtime assets. Do not commit or redistribute ROMs, generated asset packs, save
files, MSU packs, or local INI overrides.

## What You Need

All platforms need:

- Git, so you can clone and update the project.
- Python 3, so the asset extraction and randomizer scripts can run.
- A Python virtual environment with the packages in `requirements.txt`:
  `Pillow` and `PyYAML`.
- A C build path for your operating system.
- SDL2 development files or SDL2 runtime files, depending on the build path.
- A clean USA ALTTP ROM placed at the project root as `zelda3.sfc` or
  `zelda3.smc`.

Useful installer links:

- Git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Python: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
- SDL releases: <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases>
- Visual Studio Build Tools / MSBuild:
  <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild>
- PowerShell:

- Tiny C Compiler for the Windows TCC route:
  <https://github.com/FitzRoyX/tinycc/releases/tag/tcc_20251005>



After pulling updates, rebuild the executable and regenerate assets if any
source, asset script, extracted YAML, or INI behavior changed.

> Note: The Launcher can help build and randomize the project, all you have to do is supply the sfc file if you want an easier way to play.

## Randomizer Workflow

The current randomizer is an early conservative pass. It randomizes dungeon
chest item values in the extracted dungeon YAML before `zelda3_assets.dat` is
compiled. It does not yet randomize overworld checks, pot secrets, NPC rewards,
shops, boss prizes, entrances, exits, holes, sprites, or room layouts.

Fresh safe-mode workflow:

```sh
python assets/restool.py --extract-from-rom --no-build
python assets/restool-randomize.py --generate-masterlist
python assets/restool-randomize.py --seed my-first-seed --mode safe
python assets/restool.py
```

Then run the game normally. The compiled `zelda3_assets.dat` now contains the
randomized chest data.

Important notes:

- The same seed produces the same randomization.
- If `--seed` is omitted, the script generates and prints a random seed.
- Safe Mode currently keeps Lamp or Fire Rod accessible in an early light
  location before the castle throne.
- Small-key items and big-key-locked chest locations stay fixed unless you pass
  `--include-small-keys` or `--include-big-chests`.
- Spoiler logs are written to `assets/randomizer-spoilers/<seed>.md` unless
  `--no-spoiler` is used.
- Running `python assets/restool.py --extract-from-rom` after randomizing will
  overwrite the randomized YAML with clean ROM data before compiling.

Useful randomizer commands:

```sh
python assets/restool-randomize.py --seed 12345 --dry-run
python assets/restool-randomize.py --seed 12345 --exclude-room 260
python assets/restool-randomize.py --seed 12345 --exclude-item 0x32
python assets/restool-randomize.py --restore-vanilla
```

More detail lives in `assets/randomizer-instructions.md`.

## Multi-Language Assets

The default build uses the USA ROM and English assets. To build extra dialogue
assets, keep the USA ROM at the root and provide a supported localized ROM.

Example for German:

```sh
python assets/restool.py --extract-dialogue -r German.sfc
python assets/restool.py --languages=de
```

Then select the language in `zelda3.user.ini`:

```ini
!include zelda3.ini

[General]
Language = de
```

Supported language codes in the asset scripts include `de`, `fr`, `fr-c`, `en`,
`es`, `pl`, `pt`, `redux`, `nl`, and `sv`.

## Configuration Files

The default config is `zelda3.ini`. The executable tries `zelda3.user.ini`
first, then falls back to `zelda3.ini`. A good personal config starts by
including the default file, then overrides only what you want:

```ini
!include zelda3.ini

[Graphics]
WindowScale = 4
Fullscreen = 0

[General]
ExtendedAspectRatio = 16:9
FillExtendedAspectRatioBorders = 1

[Features]
ItemSwitchLR = 1
NewSettingsMenu = 1
```

`zelda3.user.ini` is ignored by the repository's `.gitignore`, so it is the
right place for personal settings.

### General

- `Autosave`: save SRAM on quit and reload it on startup.
- `DisplayPerfInTitle`: show performance info in the window title.
- `ExtendedAspectRatio`: use `4:3`, `16:9`, `16:10`, or `18:9`.
- `ExtendedAspectRatio` can also include `extend_y`, `unchanged_sprites`, or
  `no_visual_fixes` as comma-separated tokens.
- `FillExtendedAspectRatioBorders`: fills widescreen side bars from nearby
  rendered art. It only takes effect when `ExtendedAspectRatio` is active.
- `DisableFrameDelay`: removes the per-frame SDL delay. Leave it off unless you
  know your display and sync setup behave correctly.
- `Language`: selects compiled language assets, such as `de`.

### Graphics

- `WindowSize`: `Auto` or an explicit size like `1280x720`.
- `Fullscreen`: `0` windowed, `1` desktop fullscreen, `2` fullscreen with mode
  change.
- `WindowScale`: integer scale factor for the window.
- `OutputMethod`: `SDL`, `SDL-Software`, `OpenGL`, or `OpenGL ES`.
- `NewRenderer`: enables the newer PPU renderer path.
- `EnhancedMode7`: renders world map Mode 7 at higher resolution.
- `IgnoreAspectRatio`: stretches instead of preserving the aspect ratio.
- `NoSpriteLimits`: removes the original per-scanline sprite limit.
- `LinkGraphics`: path to a `.zspr` Link sprite file.
- `Shader`: path to a `.glsl` or `.glslp` shader. Shaders require `OpenGL`.
- `LinearFiltering`: smooths scaled pixels. Leave it off for crisp pixels.
- `DimFlashes`: reduces some flashing effects.

### Sound

- `EnableAudio`: master audio toggle.
- `AudioFreq`: sample rate, commonly `44100` or `48000`.
- `AudioChannels`: `1` mono or `2` stereo.
- `AudioSamples`: audio buffer size. Try `1024` if sound crackles.
- `EnableMSU`: `false`, `true`, `deluxe`, `opuz`, or `deluxe-opuz`.
- `MSUPath`: prefix for MSU files. The track number and extension are appended.
- `ResumeMSU`: resumes supported MSU tracks when returning to an area.
- `MSUVolume`: MSU playback volume from `0%` to `100%`.

PCM MSU packs expect `AudioFreq = 44100`. OPUZ packs expect `AudioFreq = 48000`.

### Features

- `ItemSwitchLR`: enables item switching on L/R and item assignment in the
  inventory.
- `ItemSwitchLRLimit`: limits L/R cycling to the first four items.
- `TurnWhileDashing`, `MirrorToDarkworld`, `CollectItemsWithSword`,
  `BreakPotsWithSword`, `MoreActiveBombs`, and `CarryMoreRupees` are gameplay
  convenience toggles.
- `MiscBugFixes` enables bug fixes that preserve normal game intent.
- `GameChangingBugFixes` enables stronger fixes that can change behavior.
- `RearrangeHUD` moves the HUD when widescreen is active.
- `NewSettingsMenu` enables the in-game settings menu on the configured key or
  gamepad button.

HUD position settings use tile coordinates in the widescreen viewport. In 16:9,
useful X values are roughly `0` through `49`, and useful Y values are roughly
`0` through `29`. The sample `zelda3.ini` contains this fork's current HUD
layout.

### KeyMap and GamepadMap

`[KeyMap]` binds keyboard keys. The `Controls` order is:

```text
Up, Down, Left, Right, Select, Start, A, B, X, Y, L, R
```

SDL key names are accepted, including modifiers like `Shift+`, `Ctrl+`, and
`Alt+`.

`[GamepadMap]` uses button names such as `DpadUp`, `DpadDown`, `Back`, `Start`,
`A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `L1`, `R1`, `Lb`, `Rb`, `L2`, and `R2`.

## Launcher Dependency Checklist

The launcher's manual install guide checks the same dependencies described
above:

- macOS: Git, Python 3, Make, and SDL2 development files.
- Windows: Git, Python 3, MSBuild or another selected build path, PowerShell,
  TCC for the lightweight route, and SDL2 for runtime/TCC.
- Linux: Git, Python 3, Make/build tools, and SDL2 development files.

The launcher should guide users to install system tools themselves. It should
not install Git, Python, Visual Studio, Build Tools, Homebrew, TCC, SDL2, or
distribution packages automatically.

## Troubleshooting

`Could not find any ROMs`

Put `zelda3.sfc` or `zelda3.smc` at the project root, or pass `-r` with a path
relative to the project root.

`ROM with hash ... not supported`

Normal extraction expects the USA release:
`Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (USA)`.

`No module named PIL` or `No module named yaml`

Use the virtual environment Python and install `requirements.txt`.

`sdl2-config: command not found`

Install SDL2 development files. On macOS this is usually `brew install sdl2`.
On Debian or Ubuntu this is `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`.

Visual Studio reports missing `packages\sdl2...targets`

Restore NuGet packages for `Zelda3.sln`. Visual Studio usually prompts for
this automatically when the solution opens.

TCC says `third_party\tcc\tcc.exe` is missing

Download the Windows TCC ZIP and place `tcc.exe` under `third_party\tcc\`.

TCC says SDL is not unzipped properly

Place `SDL2.dll` at `third_party\SDL2-2.26.3\lib\x64\SDL2.dll`.

The game starts but cannot find config or assets

Launch it from the project root or from `bin\x64-Release\`. If you move the
executable elsewhere, copy `zelda3.ini` and `zelda3_assets.dat` beside it.
